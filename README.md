# ICS125Project
Lynda and Saryta why :( <br>
Due to the cruel harsh realities of school overloading us with projects, demos, assignments, tests, labs, not having enough time, and my white hair, we are unable to complete some of the requirements of this movie project. However, using the skills taught by us in ics199 we chose some of the requirements that are in scope and out of scope. We deeply apologize for not being able to complete all of the requirements but we chose it would be in our favour to study for our exams.
